# RMT-codes
This repo contains certain measures from random matrix theory primarily used in the study of spectral fluctuations of diverse quantum systems.
We have the normal or standard ratios of adjacent level spacings (NSR) and the complex spacing ratios (CSR). The level density and NSR of real and complex Gaussian and Wishart ensembles along with the CSR, NSR and level density of the circular ensembles.  Some of the visualization tool for the results have also been provided. However they can always be improved and made better and better according to the paper/presentation. 

For the code of the CSR, I acknowledge the help of Jeremie Gince, PhD student and my colleague at the IQ, UofSherbrooke.

For the circular ensembles, the following package has been used :  https://scikit-rmt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html. Its simple to install this. The documentation is available in the website. This package contains other ensembles as well. But my codes are simple and gives the user an idea about the full construction. 

Codes coming up : Bures-Hall ensemble, the spectral form factors (SFF) and Dissipative (DSFF) , quantum kicked rotor, quantum kicked top and their dissipative versions. 

If you find these codes helpful, please mention me and if would like some other codes in RMT, something frequently used or would like to contribute, I can be reached at Ayana.Sarkar@usherbrooke.ca.
